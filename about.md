### About me 
I have a passion for data and revealing insights through visualisations and storytelling. My background is in Retail Management, where I gained a wide range of experience in people management, developing others and training. It was in this role that I developed a keen eye for detail and forensic approach to solving a problem, leading me to renew the Retail POS database and software and develop Excel forecasting workbooks and a Power BI reporting solution for the retail management team.
The process of learning whilst implementing a solution to improve business reporting, revealed a strong desire to continue seeking insights from data and ultimately, a career change into Data Analytics. 

I recently completed an intensive project-based, online Data Analytics program with Career Foundry. The course covered fundamental analytical skills, from developing a hypothesis to descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis, to predictive analysis, using key tools, such as SQL, Python and Tableau.

This portfolio of work summarises some of the key projects covered.
